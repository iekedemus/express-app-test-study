# Utilities

This folder contains some utilities used to write code in a more declarative manner:

- `lenses.js` contains utilities for using lenses, the Functional Programming equivalent of accessors
- `functions.js` contains utilities for functional composition â€“ producing complex behaviour from small functions
- `objects.js` contains utilities for manipulating objects
